You suck!
Smell ya later!
You're a silly billy!
Go ahead and fuck yourself!
You smell bad!
You’re a real stinker, ain’t ya?
Toodle-oo, you ragamuffin!
You're as sharp as a marble, see?
You smell like last week's fish, my friend!
You're a goofy gander, that's for sure!
Catch ya on the flip side, you numskull!
You're about as clever as a bag of rocks!
Scram, you bumbling buffoon!
You're the bee's knees of nonsense!
You're a real hoot, but not in a good way!
You’re as bright as a coal mine at midnight!
You’re a real flopdoodle, aren’t ya?
You smell like a barrel of spoiled apples!
You’re as welcome as a raincloud at a wedding!
You’ve got the brains of a rock, I tell ya!
You’re a real janglepot of confusion!
You’re about as charming as a wet sock!
You’re a real noodlehead, that’s for sure!
You’re as smooth as sandpaper!
You’re a delightful mess, like a cat in a yarn shop!
See ya later, alligator!
Toodles, you pesky pickle!
Catch you on the flip side, you dunderhead!
Goodbye, you charming knuckle-dragger!
Adios, you silly sausage!
Farewell, you ridiculous rascal!
Smell ya later, you whacky wiener!
Take care, you bamboozler!
Until next time, you bumbling buffoon!
Later, you quirky cobbler!
Toodle-oo, you jolly jester!
Catch ya later, you whirling dervish!
Goodbye, you charmingly clumsy oaf!
See ya in the funny papers, you goofy git!
Farewell, you delightful disaster!
Later, you wacky wiggleworm!
Adieu, you muddled mischief-maker!
Take a hike, you nutty noodle!
Until we meet again, you silly goose!
Smell ya later, you bumbling buffoon!
You’re a real numpty!
Total flop, aren’t ya?
You’re all bluster, no brains!
A true classic knucklehead!
About as sharp as butter!
You’re a silly goose!
Hot mess, cold day!
As bright as a brick!
Real charmer, if charm's lost!
You’re a walking disaster!
Total doofus!
Nice try, loser!
What a mess!
You're a flop!
Real knucklehead!
Goodbye, dimwit!
You smell funny!
Big silly!
Absolute nonsense!
Bumbling fool!
Dolt!
Nincompoop!
Muddle!
Fool!
Dunderhead!
Goof!
Numbskull!
Wretch!
Blockhead!
Twit!
